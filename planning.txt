home row most optimial?
fitness:

-ergonomics/disability
FLEKSY and KALQ
are there even ergonomics for mobile keyboards?
-ease of learning
least number of character switches
is this the only thing?
-efficiency
test varying sizes (keys have random sizes, must be placed randomly not overlapping) does a larger key increase ease of learning or speed of typing? Do larger keys necessitate other keys being way smaller? How to factor in the multiple keyboard panels
are there dominant thumbs?

-mobile testing
figure out if everyone presses space with 1 thumb
find most often used symbols (how to get corpus?)
get from online?
get from myself?
if a word is mostly on the right i use only right
some letters are switchable
thumbs are wide, try is typed with 1 finger.
how many 3 letter combinations are there that i can test?
26*26*26 or blocks of letters
multiples of space or backspace?
track how much each thumb is used, both in program and in real life
is hurdling as much of a problem? maybe it is better
is this true for mobile (the chances of stuttering are increased and a rhythm can be broken, thus decreasing speed and increasing errors and fatigue.)
don't need to preserve shortcuts. on keyboards you can set it so that holding control will switch it to qwerty to preserve shortcuts


adjacent letters are always typed together?

find a way to look for words with things like (2 in one direction, then double back)?
beryl is interesting word

faster to alternate or all with one finger? more errors one way or the other?


-mobile program
what should yy be?
2 pointers, right always presses space, left controls shift. right is backspace. backspace is encoded as $?
iterate along input string
identify if letter is on the right or left. have 2 variables. track last used.
if letter is in last used, add calculate distance from last used to current letter and add to distance and iterate letters.
fitness function can have coefficents for each of the 3 values.

is it possible to track transitions at the beginning like the original? is it better to store hard distances? probably not
should there be another dictionary for capital letters or just calculated?
should coordinates be strings?
you can move 2 thumbs at once
too much focus on perfect typing, where is backspace
