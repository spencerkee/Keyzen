systematic approach to get out of local maximum

linear and integer programming
current model doesn't take into account symmetry?
backspace key
shapes and positions of keys

predictive text
human testing

The duplicates from the resultTraverser are possibly due to symmetry issues
#probably a lot of duplicates in the picklefile
#how to check if there are duplicate dictionaries?

how can i find archetypical dictionaries? perhaps post on stackoverflow

try to improve fitness function
markov estimation
how well does it do just optimized for bigrams
can you construct a short corpus that is representitive?

Overview: problem, goals, etc
background... (process)
description of the program, full code in appendex, hypertext functions
results: fitness convergence, final keyboard, heatmapping
discussion, survey (process)
future:improvements,learning curve, mod keys
